# HashEmit

A blockchain-powered hash tracking and event management platform leveraging Stacks blockchain for secure, decentralized event verification.

## Overview

HashEmit provides a robust decentralized platform for tracking and verifying hashes and events built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The system enables users to:

- Create immutable hash records on-chain
- Control access to hash entries through granular permissions
- Verify data integrity using cryptographic proofs
- Track event history and metadata
- Manage event-specific synchronization states

## Architecture

HashEmit consists of four core smart contracts that work together to provide comprehensive hash and event management:

### hash-emit-core
The central contract managing hash references and basic event operations. It handles:
- Registration and management of hash entries
- Basic access control through sharing mechanisms
- Hash reference updates and deletion
- User hash tracking

### hash-emit-access
Handles granular permissions and access control, including:
- Role-based access control (owner, editor, viewer)
- Event authorization
- Hash entry ownership and transfers
- Access delegation and revocation

### hash-emit-integrity
Ensures data integrity and handles verification:
- Cryptographic verification of hash entries
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Version integrity tracking
- Event-specific integrity checks

### hash-emit-metadata
Manages metadata and versioning information:
- Event version history
- Hash entry synchronization status
- Event metadata and attributes
- Event registration and management

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Hash Tracking**: Store hash references securely on the Stacks blockchain
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions system with role-based access
- **Event Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of hash entries
- **Version History**: Track and manage event versions
- **Conflict Detection**: Built-in mechanisms for handling conflicting hash updates
- **Event Management**: Register and manage multiple event types
- **Metadata Tracking**: Comprehensive metadata management for hash entries

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions

```clarity
;; Register a new data reference
(register-reference (ref-id (string-utf8 128)) (hash (buff 32)) (version (string-utf8 32)) (metadata (optional (string-utf8 256))))

;; Update an existing reference
(update-reference (ref-id (string-utf8 128)) (hash (buff 32)) (version (string-utf8 32)) (metadata (optional (string-utf8 256))))

;; Share a reference with another user
(share-reference (ref-id (string-utf8 128)) (user principal) (can-update bool))
```

### Access Control

```clarity
;; Grant access to a dataset
(grant-access (dataset-id (string-utf8 36)) (user principal) (role-name (string-utf8 10)))

;; Register a new device
(register-device (device-id (string-utf8 36)) (device-name (string-utf8 64)))

;; Transfer dataset ownership
(transfer-ownership (dataset-id (string-utf8 36)) (new-owner principal))
```

### Integrity Management

```clarity
;; Submit a new data hash
(submit-data-hash (data-id (string-utf8 36)) (hash (buff 32)) (device-id (string-utf8 36)))

;; Verify data integrity
(verify-data (data-id (string-utf8 36)) (hash (buff 32)) (proof (buff 128)))

;; Resolve data conflicts
(resolve-conflict (data-id (string-utf8 36)) (selected-hash (buff 32)))
```

### Metadata Management

```clarity
;; Create content metadata
(create-content-metadata (content-id (string-utf8 36)) (title (string-utf8 128)) (content-type (string-utf8 32)) (size-bytes uint))

;; Add a new version
(add-content-version (content-id (string-utf8 36)) (hash (buff 32)) (device-id (string-utf8 36)) (change-description (string-utf8 256)) (size-bytes uint))

;; Update sync status
(update-sync-status (content-id (string-utf8 36)) (device-id (string-utf8 36)) (synced-version uint))
```

## Security Considerations

- All data references are stored as cryptographic hashes
- Only authorized devices can update data references
- Role-based access control enforces proper permissions
- Cryptographic proofs verify data integrity
- Conflict detection prevents data inconsistencies
- Device registration required for synchronization

## Getting Started

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain. To interact with AetherSync:

1. Deploy the smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Register devices using the access control contract
3. Create and manage data references through the core contract
4. Use the integrity contract to verify synchronized data
5. Track versions and metadata using the metadata contract

For detailed implementation and integration guidelines, refer to the individual contract documentation.
